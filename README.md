# capstone-project-1
Springboard Capstone Project 1 - Investors for Airbnb hosting by purchasing property.

This project will see if it is profitable to buy property and use it to host guests from Airbnb.

Investors could be interested if the profits are convincing enough. 

Data will be taken from airbnb regarding current units from around the United States, their prices and availabilities. Data will also be taken from Zillow for available housing values. Data will compare mortgage cost against expected rental income for similar size units in similar neighborhoods.  Past data can be used to try to predict current values for both airbnb rentals and Zillow property values. 


Notes: compare data from different cities, focusing on the neighborhood level, and specific type of units. build machine learning to predict on avalibity and prices. describe who is the investors and keep that in mind. Investors will want to have all their properties in one city and will want to know what the prices and availibility. Skip the zillow part. predicting airbnb value and availibity. Investor will want to know where to look for. 

Write structure that comes from Airbnb (many files with similar structure) and how they will be combined. good paragraph about that. 

What is the problem you want to solve?

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
