Springboard Capstone Project 1 - Investors for Airbnb hosting by purchasing property.

This project will see if it is profitable to buy property and use it to host guests from Airbnb.

Investors could be interested if the profits are convincing enough. 

Data will be taken from airbnb regarding current units from around the United States, their prices and availabilities. Data will also be taken from Zillow for available housing values. Data will compare mortgage cost against expected rental income for similar size units in similar neighborhoods.  Past data can be used to try to predict current values for both airbnb rentals and Zillow property values.
