Springboard Capstone Project 1

I am still struggling for ideas for the first capstone project. I have used expedia and airbnb a lot over the past years so I found ideas 1 and 2 to be very interesting. I also find number 3 to be very interesting as I had built muon detectors during graduate school that was used at Fermi Lab and even brought over to Cern for testing but this project may be too difficult. 4. This is a dataset for credit card fraud although it seems too vague. As far as I can tell the only usuable data is time, amount and fruad. 5. Original idea about analyzing movie industry before and after the age of online piracy. I am still open to new ideas.


1. Expedia Hotel Recommendations from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data
From kaggle "Your goal of this competition is to predict the booking outcome (hotel cluster) for a user event, based on their search and other attributes associated with that user event." also "Note that some srch_destination_id's in the train/test files don't exist in the destinations.csv file. This is because some hotels are new and don't have enough features in the latent space. Your algorithm should be able to handle this missing information."


2. Airbnb New User Bookings from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data
Not too different from from idea 1. "In this challenge, you are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. You are asked to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.

There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'. Please note that 'NDF' is different from 'other' because 'other' means there was a booking, but is to a country not included in the list, while 'NDF' means there wasn't a booking."


3. Flavours of Physics: Finding τ → μμμ from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics  "In this competition, you are given a list of collision events and their properties. You will then predict whether a τ → 3μ decay happened in this collision. This τ → 3μ is currently assumed by scientists not to happen, and the goal of this competition is to discover τ → 3μ happening more frequently than scientists currently can understand.

It is challenging to design a machine learning problem for something you have never observed before. Scientists at CERN developed the following designs to achieve the goal."


4. Credit Card Fraud Detection from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud "The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions." 


5. Is the US film industry actually making less money since the age of online piracy? Has the dip been distrubited evenly across genres? I would get this information imdb.
